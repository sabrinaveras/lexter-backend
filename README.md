# Lexter Backend

The goal of this project is to test my skill as a back-end developer.Using NodeJs as language, the server was started using [express](https://expressjs.com/pt-br/).
The database was made in [mongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/1) using [mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) to make the connection.
The database is hosted on [mongo atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/lp/try2?utm_source=google&utm_campaign=gs_americas_brazil_search_brand_atlas_desktop&utm_term=mongodb%20atlas&utm_medium=cpc_paid_search&utm_ad=e&utm_ad_campaign_id=1718986516&gclid=Cj0KCQiA2uH-BRCCARIsAEeef3neG7swxllXchw-rcKl0pwjG--2MKmTFIDEICusFs9wWK5a8irpo6kaAlC1EALw_wcB) for better visualization of data on the website
